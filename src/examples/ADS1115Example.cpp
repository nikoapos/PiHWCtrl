 * Description
 * -----------
 * 
 * Simple example of how to use the ADS1115 class. This class can control the
 * module ADS1115, which is an analog to digital converter, using the I2C
 * protocol.
 * 
 * The ADS1115 has four analog inputs and it capable to measure the following
 * differential voltages:
 * 
 * - IN 0 - IN 1
 * - IN 0 - IN 3
 * - IN 1 - IN 3
 * - IN 2 - IN 3
 * - IN 0 - GND
 * - IN 1 - GND
 * - IN 2 - GND
 * - IN 3 - GND
 * 
 * Note that all inputs must not be in the range [-0.3V, VDD+0.3V] and that 
 * voltages outside this range can harm the device!
 * 
 * The device itself can measure a single voltage difference at a time and it
 * provides a CONTINUOUS mode, which continuously repeats the measurement. This
 * class hides from the user the fact of a single measurement per time and it
 * provides its own continuous method, which internally switches the multiplexer
 * to chose all the input combinations for which the values are requested. At
 * the moment the native continuous mode is not accessible.
 * 
 * Similarly, the ADS1115 class extends the hardware functionality by accepting
 * separate gain values for each input, and a special auto-gain mode, which
 * switches the gain option to best fit the input.
 * 
 * Hardware implementation
 * -----------------------
 * Materials:
 *   - An ADS1115 breakout
 *   - Two potentiometers
 * 
 * Connection:
 *   - Connect the GND of the ADS1115 to one of the GND pins
 *   - Connect the VIN of the ADS1115 to one of the 3.3V pins
 *   - Connect the SCL of the ADS1115 to the SCL pin (pin 5 / GPIO 3)
 *   - Connect the SDA of the ADS1115 to the SDA pin (pin 3 / GPIO 2)
 *   - Connect the ADDR of the ADS1115 to one of the GND pins
 *   - Connect the potentiometers one outer pin to one of the GND pins
 *   - Connect the potentiometers other outer pin to one of the 3.3V pins
 *   - Connect the first potentiometer inner pin to the A0 of the ADS1115
 *   - Connect the first potentiometer inner pin to the A3 of the ADS1115
 *   - Connect the A2 of the ADS1115 to one of the GND pins
 * 
 * Execution:
 * Run the example. It will start printing the differential voltages of the
 * A0 to the ground and the A2 to A3. Try to move the potentiometers from side
 * to side to see the values changing. The program will exit after 10 seconds.

  // number of measurements performed per second. Higher sampling rates result
  // to less accurate, but faster and more power efficient measurements.
  //
  // Note that there can be a single instance of ADS1115 per address pin, as it
  // represents the actual hardware. For this reason the factory returns a
  // unique_ptr to the instance. If you want to share it between classes, you
  // can store it in a shared_ptr.

  // override (or re-enable) this behavior for a specific input, by calling the
  // setGain() method.

  //
  // After you have setup your ADS1115 class, you can retrieve its measurements
  // by one of three ways, as shown below.
  //
  
  //
  // The first way to get the sensor measurements is to directly call the
  // methods of the class. Note that in this case each method call will contact
  // the sensor to perform all the required measurements (no caching is
  // performed) and it will block until the measurement is done. The blocking
  // time depends on the data rate selected.

  std::cout << "   IN2-IN3: " << in2 << " V\n";
  std::cout << "       IN0: " << in0 << " V\n";
  
  //
  // The second way to get the sensor measurements is by using the methods that
  // return AnalogInput implementations. The objects returned by these methods
  // are implementing the AnalogInput interface and can be used anywhere an
  // AnalogInput is expected. As with the direct method calls, the AnalogInputs
  // will trigger the measurements and will block until they are finished.
  //
  std::cout << "\nGetting the information using the AnalogInputs:\n";

  print("IN0", *in0_ai);
  print("IN2-IN3", *in2_in3_ai);
  
  //
  // The last way to get the sensor measurements is by registering observers to
  // the ADS1115 class and call its start() method. This will put the class in
  // continuous measurement mode and it will notify the observers every time a
  // measurement is finished. You can always stop the measurements by calling
  // the stop() method.
  //
  // Note that the observer methods will be called in the measurements thread,
  // so if their actions are taking too long they will block the measurements.
  // If this is the case the observer should delegate the action to a separate
  // thread.
