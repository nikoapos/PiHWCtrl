/*
 * Description
 * -----------
 * 
 * Simple example of how to use the GpioSwitch class. This class implements
 * the PiHWCtrl::Switch interface and can be used to control the output of the
 * GPIO pins accessible via the 40 pin interface (GPIOs 2-28) as ON (3.3 Volt)
 * or OFF (GND).
 * 
 * Hardware implementation
 * -----------------------
 * Materials:
 *   - A LED (with forward voltage less than 3.3 Volt)
 *   - A 330 ohm resistor (if you want to properly calculate the value see
 *     here: http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2012/resistors-for-leds)
 * 
 * Connections:
 *   - Connect the GPIO-26 pin to the anode of the LED (longer leg)
 *   - Connect the cathode of the LED (shorter leg) to the one side of the
 *     resistor
 *   - Connect the other side of the resistor to the ground (GND)
 * 
 * Execution:
 * Run the example. The LED should turn ON and OFF 10 times.
